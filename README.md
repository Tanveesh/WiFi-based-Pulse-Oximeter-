# WiFi-based-Pulse-Oximeter-
In this DIY IoT Project, we will try to make a Smart Health Monitoring Device that can measure SpO2 (percentage of oxygen in the blood) and heart rate in BPM (Beat Per Minute). This wearable device can be used by athletes to monitor their heart rate and blood oxygen levels during a workout. The Best part of this project is that you can connect this device to an Android app Blynk that will record and regularly update the data for both SPO2 &amp; BPM on the internet. Even anyone can monitor the data from any part of the world as data are uploaded on server.  As there is an availability of online data, so this project can be used to monitor the health of a patient online. The pulse oximeter available in the market is very expensive, but with this simple &amp; low-cost pulse oximeter module, we can make our own device. So letâ€™s learn how to make MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter with ESP8266.
